What happens when you initialize a respository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory with metadata about the history of the repository since it was created.
You need to do it so you can make commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it contains only the 
files that we want to track changes for. It is different from the repository in that 
the repository is where actual commits are stored.

It allows you to decide which specific files you want to track changes for instead of 
tracking all files.
