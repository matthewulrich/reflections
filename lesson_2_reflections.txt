What happens when you initialize a respository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory with metadata about the history of the repository since it 
was created.
You need to do it so you can make commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it contains only the 
files that we want to track changes for. It is different from the repository in that 
the repository is where actual commits are stored.

It allows you to decide which specific files you want to track changes for instead of 
tracking all files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logicl change?

When you have made a logical change, you can add it to the staging area and commit it. 
If you have made a change and already commited it, the staging area will be empty when 
you check it, so you will know that you have made the commit.

What are sme situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful keeping your history organized when you make experimental versions 
of files, or different versions of files.
Branches help by keeping your experimental or new changes separate from your official 
version, so that you can always go back to it later. Also, if you find a bug in the 
official version, you can fix it without changing other versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure.

They help by showing you all the branches as well as the various commits that have been 
made and the reachability of each commit to other commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the 
diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is that we combine the code from the final 
commits of both of those branches into one file while looking at the original commit as 
a reference.

We represent it in the diagram the way we do because we are bringing the code in both 
branches together into one file.
