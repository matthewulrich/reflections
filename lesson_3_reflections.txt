When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating with other people 
on a project, or when you want to work from two different computers and push all your 
changes to one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually because you might have made changes to your master 
branch since you last pushed it and another user might have made changes to the one in the 
remote repository, so they will have diverged, and pulling changes will override your 
changes to the local master.
