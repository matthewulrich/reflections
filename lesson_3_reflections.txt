When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating with other people 
on a project, or when you want to work from two different computers and push all your 
changes to one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually because you might have made changes to your master 
branch since you last pushed it and another user might have made changes to the one in the 
remote repository, so they will have diverged, and pulling changes will override your 
changes to the local master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When wuld you use one instead 
of another.

A fork is a clone that is made on GitHub. A clone is code that you pull down from GitHub to 
your own machine. A branch is a label for code that is not part of the master version of the 
code.
You use a fork when you want to make a copy of someone else's repository directly on the 
GitHub servers. A clone is used when you want to pull a repository that is on GitHub down to 
your local machine. A branch is used when you want to create separate commits that don't 
affect the main branch if you wanted to try out some experimental feature.
